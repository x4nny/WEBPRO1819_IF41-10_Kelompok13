          The free online diary monkkee offers you the safest place for your thoughts. A comprehensive security concept protects your content against unauthorized access. And this is how it works:
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as content created by you is saved, it is directly encrypted on your computer, i.e. even before its leaves your device and is transferred to the server via the Internet. With this end-to-end encryption approach monkkee set themselves apart from other competitors who do not encrypt user data at all or only provide server-side encryption.
        </p>
        <img class="security-img" src="assets/img/encryption_process.png" alt="encryption_process"></img>
        <p class="a-title">
          The decryption key for monkkee is your password, which you must enter each time you log on. The encryption method used is AES-256. Initially developed for military purposes, this highly secure encoding technology is nowadays used by governments, institutions and banks to encrypt top-secret information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The encrypted data is transferred directly between your device and the server. For this purpose, monkkee uses an additional SSL-based encryption technology. That way, no one can eavesdrop on the transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only you can decrypt your entries now, since you are the only one to know the password. This means that even the system administrators of monkkee cannot read your data. It also means that it is not possible to hand data over to government authorities, as is currently being discussed in the media. As a side effect, it is not possible to restore your password in case you forget it. So always remember your password – there is no spare key!
        </p>

          In fact, monkkee is funded exclusively through donations from its users and through the ongoing support of the monkkee founders. monkkee was born out of passion for the cause and the desire to create great software. It is the work of a few passionate individuals, not one of large internet companies. With its client-side encryption, we’re convinced that monkkee is a unique product and we want to make the software accessible to any person wishing to use it.

            Our long-term goal is for monkkee to be fully community-driven and pay for itself. To make this work, we depend on regular donations. The more donations we receive, the more secure monkkee’s future. Donations are used to run and maintain the software, develop new features and, last but not least, pay the bills for our server hosting costs, which have increased considerably since our start in 2013 due to the growing user base and increased storage needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to shape monkkee’s future together with you. As a crowd, we are strong and can compete with commercial providers. If you have never made a donation before, please consider helping us with a small contribution. We are grateful for every single donation we receive, no matter how small or big!
